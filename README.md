# MasonPrank
Computer control over Mason's desktop as a prank. Includes mouse control and randomly played sounds

The Final jar is the actual .jar that will be used on Mason's machine for mass paranoia. The pranks happen randomly between 5-30 minutes.

The actual output artifact in the artifact folder happens every 15-30 seconds and is used for testing purposes.

#Pranks
* Ghost Voices: One of 6 sound bytes will play. Two are door knocking. Four are Dane saying variations of "Hey Mason"
* Mouse Control: The mouse will jump to the top left corner of the monitor three times.
* Mouse Button Control: The left and right mouse button will be flipped for a period of 6 seconds.
